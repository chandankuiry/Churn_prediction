# Churn_prediction
Customer churn prediction using logistic regression ,AdaBoost classifier,Random forest classifier ,Naive Bayes classifier,
# What is churn ?
Churn prediction is to detect which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service. We have  to predict the answer to the following question: “Is this customer going to leave us within the next X months?” There are only two possible answers, yes or no; It is a binary classification problem.

# Project guide:

In churn_prediction.ipynb file I used logistic regression ,AdaBoost classifier,Random forest classifier ,Naive Bayes classifier to predict customer churn . 

In RandomForest2.ipynb file I used Random forest classifier better way to predict churn .

In RandomForest2.ipynb file ln[39] same as churn_prediction.ipynb because data preprocessing part is same .


#How can you proceed?
So first go through churn_prediction.ipynb file and then RandomForest2.ipynb file .
